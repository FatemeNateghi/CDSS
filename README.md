Shared workspace in development

General Guidlines:
* Avoid any large data files, so the repo stays lightweight for new devs to quickly download/clone.
* For one-off or very project specific files and scripts, basically do whatever you want in the workspace areas under the scripts directory (but again, avoid big data files).
* Try to promote reusable components to the medinfo core application modules.
